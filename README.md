# Indigo Selfbot
A free open-source discord selfbot created in `python` using packages such as `discord.py-self` and `discum`. Filled with commands such as `massmention` and `dankmemerfarmer`.

## Info
Some people have been using the `discord.py` module, we've switched from this to `discord.py-self` as it has better support.
To install `discord.py-self` do the following:
```bash
pip[3] install -U discord.py-self
```

## Usage

```bash
python[3] main.py
```
## Installation

To install you can either use git, or download the zip directly \
**If you are using git do the following**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gowixx/indigo-selfbot.git
```
----
```bash
cd indigo-selfbot
```

```bash
setup.bat
```
^ If you're on linux do it urself lol ^
---
```bash
python[3] main.py
```

## Common Errors
Sometimes you may get the following error: 
```bash
Connection Dropped. Retrying in 10 seconds.
```
This means that your account has been ratelimited, to fix it you have a couple days, or use another account. This has nothing to do with your IP Adress.
Another way to fix it and immediately use it, is enter the command `kill 1` in console.
