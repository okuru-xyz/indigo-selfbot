# Indigo Selfbot
A free open-source discord selfbot created in `python` using packages such as `discord.py-self` and `discum`. Filled with commands such as `massmention` and `dankmemerfarmer`.

## Info

To install `discord.py-self` do the following:
```bash
pip[3] install -U discord.py-self
```

## Usage

```bash
python[3] main.py
